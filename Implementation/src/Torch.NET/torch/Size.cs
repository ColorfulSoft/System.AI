//*      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

//*      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

//*      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
//*      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
//*      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

//*      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
//*      as of the date such litigation is filed.
//*
//*   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

//*
//*      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
//*          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
//*          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
//*          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
//*          the Derivative Works; and
//*
//*      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
//*          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
//*          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
//*          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
//*          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
//*          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
//*          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
//*          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
//*          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
//*          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
//*          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
//*          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
//*          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
//*          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
//*          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
//*          as modifying the License.
//*
//*      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
//*      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
//*      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
//*      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
//*      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
//*      the conditions stated in this License.
//*
//*   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
//*      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
//*      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
//*      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
//*      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
//*      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
//*      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
//*
//*   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
//*      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
//*      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
//*      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
//*
//*   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
//*      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
//*      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
//*      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
//*      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
//*      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
//*      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
//*      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
//*      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
//*
//*   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
//*      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
//*      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
//*      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
//*      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
//*      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
//*      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
//*      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
//*      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
//*      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
//*      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
//*
//*   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
//*      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
//*      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
//*      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
//*      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
//*      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
//*      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
//*      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
//*      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
//*      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
//*
//*    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
